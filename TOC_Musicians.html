  <p>
    <h3>▼ Count Basie</h3>
    <img src="Count Basie.PNG" width="500px">
    William James "Count" Basie (/ˈbeɪsi/; August 21, 1904 – April 26, 1984) was an American jazz pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. In 1935,<br>
    Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, the Count Basie Orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording.<br>
    He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two "split" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing<br>
    with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor<br>
    saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry "Sweets" Edison, plunger trombonist Al<br>
    Grey, and singers Jimmy Rushing, Helen Humes, Thelma Carpenter, and Joe Williams.

    <h3>▼ Duke Ellington</h3>
    <img src="Duke Ellington.PNG" width="500px">
    Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington (April 29, 1899 – May 24, 1974) was an American composer, pianist, and leader of a jazz orchestra, which he led from<br>
    1923 until his death over a career spanning more than six decades. Born in Washington, D.C., Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s<br>
    onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe.<br>
    Although widely considered a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase "beyond category" as a liberating principle and <br>
    referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music.

    <h3>▼ Sonny Rollins</h3>
    <img src="Sonny Rollins.PNG" width="500px">
    Walter Theodore "Sonny" Rollins (born September 7, 1930) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist who is widely recognized as one of the most important and<br>
    influential jazz musicians. In a seven-decade career, he has recorded over sixty albums as a leader. A number of his compositions, including "St. Thomas",<br>
    "Oleo", "Doxy", "Pent-Up House", and "Airegin", have become jazz standards. Rollins has been called "the greatest living improviser" and the "Saxophone Colossus".<br>

    <h3>▼ Ornette Coleman</h3>
    <img src="Ornette Coleman.PNG" width="500px">
    Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman (March 9 or 19, 1930 – June 11, 2015) was an American jazz saxophonist, violinist, trumpeter, and composer. In the 1960s,
    he was one of the founders of free jazz, a term he invented for his album Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation. His "Broadway Blues" and "Lonely Woman"
    have become standards and are cited as important early works in free jazz. His album Sound Grammar received the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Music.

    <h3>▼ Charlie Parker</h3>
    <img src="Charlie Parker.PNG" width="500px">
    Charles "Charlie" Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920 – March 12, 1955), nicknamed "Bird", was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Parker was a highly influential<br>
    soloist and leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and advanced harmonies. Parker was a<br>
    blazingly fast virtuoso and introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas into jazz, including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions.<br>
    Primarily a player of the alto saxophone, Bird's tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber.
